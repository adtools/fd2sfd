fd2sfd is a parser that converts FD files and clib files to SFD files.
FD and clib files contain information about functions in shared
libraries.  fd2sfd reads these two files and merges the information
contained therein, producing an output file suitable for futher
processing using 'sfd' or 'sfdc'.

fd2sfd is based on fd2inline 1.38 by Wolfgang Baron, Rainer F. Trunz,
Kamil Iskra, Ralph Schmidt, Emmanuel Lesueur and Martin Blom.
